## Quick Start

### Download the Data

**JSON Format** (Recommended for developers):
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4dh/datapointeslab-database/main/data/pointe_shoes.json
```

**Excel Format** (Recommended for researchers):
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4dh/datapointeslab-database/main/data/STANDARD_POINTES_DB_CONSOLIDATED.xlsx
```

### Using the Data

#### Python Example
```python
import json
import pandas as pd

# Load JSON data
with open('pointe_shoes.json', 'r') as f:
    shoes_data = json.load(f)

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(shoes_data)

# Example: Find all shoes with medium box shape
medium_box_shoes = df[df['box_shape'] == 'Medium']
print(f"Found {len(medium_box_shoes)} shoes with medium box shape")
```

#### R Example
```r
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)

# Load data
shoes_data <- fromJSON("pointe_shoes.json")

# Example: Analyze price ranges by brand
price_analysis <- shoes_data %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_min_price = mean(price_min, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_max_price = mean(price_max, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## Data Sources

This database aggregates information from multiple sources to provide comprehensive pointe shoe specifications:

| Source Type | Description | Coverage | Last Updated | Reliability |
|-------------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Manufacturer Websites** | Official product specifications and catalogs | All brands | 2024-06 | High |
| **Authorized Retailers** | Product listings and detailed specifications | Major models | 2024-06 | High |
| **Dance Supply Stores** | Professional fitting guides and product details | Popular models | 2024-05 | Medium-High |
| **Dancer Communities** | User reviews and real-world experience | Various models | 2024-06 | Medium |
| **Industry Publications** | Magazines and professional reviews | New releases | 2024-05 | Medium-High |


### Source Verification Process

1. **Primary Sources**: Manufacturer websites and official documentation (highest priority)
2. **Cross-Reference**: Multiple sources verified against each other
3. **Community and ExpertValidation**: Experienced dancers provide real-world feedback
4. **Continuous Updates**: Regular monitoring of source changes

### Data Quality Notes

- **Manufacturer Data**: Most reliable for current models, may lack detailed fitting characteristics
- **Retailer Data**: Good for availability and pricing, specifications may vary
- **Professional Input**: Excellent for fitting nuances, limited to fitter experience
- **Community Data**: Valuable for real-world performance, subject to individual variation
- **Historical Data**: Important for completeness, may be less accurate due to age
- **AI-Assisted Research**: Claude Sonnet, Perplexity, and OpenAI GPT-4.1 assisted in data collection, research, and validation processes
- **AI-Human Validation System**: a software system to do additional data collection and validation via perplexity was developed to improve accuracy of model specs

### Known Limitations

- Some discontinued models may have incomplete specifications
- Pricing data reflects approximate ranges and varies by region
- Customization options may not reflect all available variations
- New model releases may have limited initial data
- There may be innacuracies in the data due to mistakes in data collection or assumptions
